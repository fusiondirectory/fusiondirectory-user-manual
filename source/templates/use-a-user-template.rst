Here is an example of how templates works. 

We will take the most common example of creating a user from a template.


Click on tab or icon Users, in the Users and groups section in FusionDirectory

A new page called Creating a new object using templates will appear. Choose the template the you wish to use from the drop-down menu

You will now automatically see the User tab filled as per the macros you have put in your template.
