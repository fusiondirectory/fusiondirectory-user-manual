Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.7.4 to 1.0.8
=============================================


Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Remove the deprecated plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The rolemanagement plugin has been integrated to the core so it must be
removed.

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get --purge remove fusiondirectory-plugin-rolemanagement
   
The board plugin has been renamed so it must be replaced

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get --purge remove fusiondirectory-plugin-board
   apt-get install fusiondirectory-plugin-dashboard

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to update your LDAP schemas, first update the FusionDirectory
core schemas.

.. code-block:: shell

   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema

   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd-conf.schema

After that you have to update the schema for the plugins you are using.
In this version the following schema have to be updated

- argonaut-fd-schema
- ipmi-fd.schema
- repository-fd.schema

Migration of the FusionDirectory acls
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FusionDirectory acl management has been changed from 1.0.7 to 1.0.8, so
they need to be migrated. We added a command to fusiondirectory-setup
for that.

.. code-block:: shell

   fusiondirectory-setup --migrate-acls

.. warning::

   This is tricky, don't forget to write down you acl first in case it doesnt work
