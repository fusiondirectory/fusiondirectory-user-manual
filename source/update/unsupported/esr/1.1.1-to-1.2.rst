Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.1.1 to 1.2
=========================================


New Depot Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    !: The repositories have been cleaned and reorganized please update
    your configuration accordingly :!:

`Downloading from Repositories <en:dl_install>`__

    !: the gpg keys for FusionDirectory and Argonaut have been renewed
    so you need to install the new keys for the packages to install
    correctly :!:

`Getting the official GPG keys to active package
signature <en:documentation:admin_get_ggp_keys>`__

Upgrade schema2ldif
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Jessie distribution add extra repository

#. fusiondirectory debian-extra repository

deb http://repos.fusiondirectory.org/fusiondirectory-extra/debian-jessie
jessie main

Update the package list and upgrade schema2ldif

``apt-get`` ``update`` ``apt-get`` ``install`` ``schema2ldif``

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

``apt-get`` ``install`` ``fusiondirectory``

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

``apt-get`` ``install`` ``fusiondirectory-schema``

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade core schema of FusionDirectory

``fusiondirectory-insert-schema`` ``-m``
``/etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema``

if you are using the renater plugin you have to add its new schema

``fusiondirectory-insert-schema`` ``-m``
``/etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/renater-partage-fd.schema``

if you are using the sympa plugin you have to update its schema

``fusiondirectory-insert-schema`` ``-i``
``/etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/sympa-fd-conf.schema``
``fusiondirectory-insert-schema`` ``-m``
``/etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/sympa-fd.schema``

In case you use system template that have a DNS tab, you need to remake
it because the separator "\|" is changed to "^"

Enjoy :)
