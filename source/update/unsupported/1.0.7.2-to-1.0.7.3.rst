Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.7.2 to 1.0.7.3
===============================================


Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You have to update your LDAP schemas, first update the FusionDirectory
core schemas. We have put a new option in fusiondirectory-insert-schema
that allow you to update easily your schema without the use of ldif
files.

In this version only the schema from the argonaut plugin needs to be
update if you have the systems or argonaut plugins installed

``fusiondirectory-insert-schema`` ``-m``
``/etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/argonaut-fd.schema``
