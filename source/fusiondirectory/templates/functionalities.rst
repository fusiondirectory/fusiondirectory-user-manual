Functionalities
===============

FusionDirectory templates allow you to automatically fill some fields at object creation, or automatically fill them on existing objects to make them consistent by applying a template. 

    * Define precisely how the attributes will be constructed, uppercase, lowercase, first letter of an attribute+4 letters of another attribute ...
    * Fill other attributes based on value stored elsewhere
    * Generate random password
    * Calculate date / time for account expiration

and so much more ...
