Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.0.18 to 1.0.19
=============================================


Ubuntu 12.0.4 TLS users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   Since 1.0.9.2 FusionDirectory need the php-cas library for CAS server
   support. This library can normally found in universe in the Ubuntu
   repositories.

In case you did not find it, grab the deb from here and install it

`<https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/all/php-cas/download>`_

and select your preferred mirror

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No upgrade

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

No Upgrade

Correcting acl editownpwd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

   To fix the error in the installed editownpwd, you need to go :

   - Acl roles
   - Open the editownpwd acl
   - Save it

Its very important you do it, to know why look at `the users must update
his role editownpasswd <https://gitlab.fusiondirectory.org/fusiondirectory/fd/issues/5276>`__

Enjoy :)
