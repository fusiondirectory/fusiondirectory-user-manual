Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.1.1 to 1.2
=========================================

New gpg keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    The gpg keys for FusionDirectory and Argonaut have been renewed
    so you need to install the new keys for the packages to install
    correctly

    :ref:`old-gpg-keys-label`.


Upgrade schema2ldif
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For Jessie distribution add extra repository

.. code-block:: shell

   #fusiondirectory debian-extra repository

   deb http://repos.fusiondirectory.org/fusiondirectory-extra/debian-jessie jessie main

Update the package list and upgrade schema2ldif

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get update
   apt-get install schema2ldif

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Upgrade of LDAP directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade core schema of FusionDirectory

.. code-block:: shell

   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/core-fd.schema

if you are using the renater plugin you have to add its new schema

.. code-block:: shell

   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/renater-partage-fd.schema

if you are using the sympa plugin you have to update its schema

.. code-block:: shell

   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -i /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/sympa-fd-conf.schema
   
   fusiondirectory-insert-schema -m /etc/ldap/schema/fusiondirectory/sympa-fd.schema

In case you use system template that have a DNS tab, you need to remake
it because the separator "\|" is changed to "^"

Enjoy :)
