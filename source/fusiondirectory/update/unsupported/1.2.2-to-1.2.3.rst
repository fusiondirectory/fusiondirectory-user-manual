Migrate FusionDirectory from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3
===========================================                                       

New gpg keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. warning::

    The gpg keys for FusionDirectory and Argonaut have been renewed
    so you need to install the new keys for the packages to install
    correctly

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory

Upgrade FusionDirectory schema package too.

.. code-block:: shell

   apt-get install fusiondirectory-schema

Enjoy :)
