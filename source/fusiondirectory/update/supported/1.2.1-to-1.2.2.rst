New Depot Configuration

   your configuration accordingly

   :ref:`rpm-repository-label`.

.. warning::

    The gpg keys for FusionDirectory and Argonaut have been renewed
    so you need to install the new keys for the packages to install
    correctly

Upgrade FusionDirectory first
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Upgrade FusionDirectory core package before other ones to avoid
dependencies errors:
