Description
===========

The Autofs plugin is used to manage autofs through an LDAP directory.

Autofs is a program for automatically mounting directories on an as-needed basis. 

Auto-mounts are mounted only as they are accessed, and are unmounted after a period of inactivity. 

Because of this, automounting NFS/Samba shares conserves bandwidth and offers better overall performance compared to static mounts via fstab.
