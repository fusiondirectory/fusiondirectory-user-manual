Functionalities
===============

FusionDirectory WebService plugin exposes a JSONRPC webservice that you can use if you want to access LDAP content through FusionDirectory system.
This way, you ensure that your ldap objects are kept consistent, your are able to use the system templates and have restrictions applied by acls.

On top of that you have a nicer API than the low-level LDAP one.

The JSONRPC API is documented `here <https://stable-api.fusiondirectory.info/classfdRPCService.html#details>`_.
